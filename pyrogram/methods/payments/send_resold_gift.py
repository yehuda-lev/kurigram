        .. note::

            Gifts already owned by the current user must be transferred using :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.transfer_gift` and can't be passed to this method.

                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            price (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.GiftResalePrice`, *optional*):
                The price that the user agreed to pay for the gift.
